The paper focuses on a special type of recommender system aimed to advise an improvement of a user\\u2019s presentation based on slides classification. Classification is a fundamental task in information extraction and retrieval with a goal to assign given resource to a predefined class. In some cases, as in slides\\u2019 categorization, resources can belong to multiple classes, leading to a multi-labelled classification problem. Two different approaches for solving a multi-labelled image classification problem for the purpose of a presentation recommender system are suggested and evaluated in the paper. They are based on problem transformation and algorithm adaptation strategies and utilize a convolutional neural network for model training.\",\n          \"Background We present FHIR-PYrate, a Python package to handle the full clinical data collection and extraction process. The software is to be plugged into a modern hospital domain, where electronic patient records are used to handle the entire patient\\u2019s history. Most research institutes follow the same procedures to build study cohorts, but mainly in a non-standardized and repetitive way. As a result, researchers spend time writing boilerplate code, which could be used for more challenging tasks. Methods The package can improve and simplify existing processes in the clinical research environment. It collects all needed functionalities into a straightforward interface that can be used to query a FHIR server, download imaging studies and filter clinical documents. The full capacity of the search mechanism of the FHIR REST API is available to the user, leading to a uniform querying process for all resources, thus simplifying the customization of each use case. Additionally, valuable features like parallelization and filtering are included to make it more performant. Results As an exemplary practical application, the package can be used to analyze the prognostic significance of routine CT imaging and clinical data in breast cancer with tumor metastases in the lungs. In this example, the initial patient cohort is first collected using ICD-10 codes. For these patients, the survival information is also gathered. Some additional clinical data is retrieved, and CT scans of the thorax are downloaded. Finally, the survival analysis can be computed using a deep learning model with the CT scans, the TNM staging and positivity of relevant markers as input. This process may vary depending on the FHIR server and available clinical data, and can be customized to cover even more use cases. Conclusions FHIR-PYrate opens up the possibility to quickly and easily retrieve FHIR data, download image data, and search medical documents for keywords within a Python package. With the demonstrated functionality, FHIR-PYrate opens an easy way to assemble research collectives automatically.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

in remote sensing image analysis by classifying pixels However the existing methods require more spatial global information interaction and feature extraction capabilities To overcome these challenges this paper proposes a novel model for hyperspectral image classification using an orthogonal self attention ResNet and a two step support vector machine OSANet TSSVM The OSANet TSSVM model comprises two essential components a deep feature extraction network and an improved support vector machine SVM classification module The deep feature extraction network incorporates an orthogonal self attention module OSM and a channel attention module CAM to enhance the spatial spectral feature extraction The OSM focuses on computing D self attention weights for the orthogonal dimensions of an image resulting in a reduced number of parameters while capturing comprehensive global contextual information In contrast the CAM independently learns attention weights along the channel dimension The CAM autonomously learns attention weights along the channel dimension enabling the deep network to emphasise crucial channel information and enhance the spectral feature extraction capability In addition to the feature extraction network the OSANet TSSVM model leverages an improved SVM classification module known as the two step support vector machine TSSVM model This module preserves the discriminative outcomes of the first level SVM subclassifier and remaps them as new features for the TSSVM training By integrating the results of the two classifiers the deficiencies of the individual classifiers were effectively compensated resulting in significantly enhanced classification accuracy The performance of the proposed OSANet TSSVM model was thoroughly evaluated using public datasets The experimental results demonstrated that the model performed well in both subjective and objective evaluation metrics The superiority of this model highlights its potential for advancing hyperspectral image classification in remote sensing applications\",\n          \"AI powered records science is revolutionizing the way facts are analyzed and understood It can significantly improve

The paper focuses on a special type of recommender system aimed to advise an improvement of a user\\u2019s presentation based on slides classification. Classification is a fundamental task in information extraction and retrieval with a goal to assign given resource to a predefined class. In some cases, as in slides\\u2019 categorization, resources can belong to multiple classes, leading to a multi-labelled classification problem. Two different approaches for solving a multi-labelled image classification problem for the purpose of a presentation recommender system are suggested and evaluated in the paper. They are based on problem transformation and algorithm adaptation strategies and utilize a convolutional neural network for model training.\",\n          \"Background We present FHIR-PYrate, a Python package to handle the full clinical data collection and extraction process. The software is to be plugged into a modern hospital domain, where electronic patient records are used to handle the entire patient\\u2019s history. Most research institutes follow the same procedures to build study cohorts, but mainly in a non-standardized and repetitive way. As a result, researchers spend time writing boilerplate code, which could be used for more challenging tasks. Methods The package can improve and simplify existing processes in the clinical research environment. It collects all needed functionalities into a straightforward interface that can be used to query a FHIR server, download imaging studies and filter clinical documents. The full capacity of the search mechanism of the FHIR REST API is available to the user, leading to a uniform querying process for all resources, thus simplifying the customization of each use case. Additionally, valuable features like parallelization and filtering are included to make it more performant. Results As an exemplary practical application, the package can be used to analyze the prognostic significance of routine CT imaging and clinical data in breast cancer with tumor metastases in the lungs. In this example, the initial patient cohort is first collected using ICD-10 codes. For these patients, the survival information is also gathered. Some additional clinical data is retrieved, and CT scans of the thorax are downloaded. Finally, the survival analysis can be computed using a deep learning model with the CT scans, the TNM staging and positivity of relevant markers as input. This process may vary depending on the FHIR server and available clinical data, and can be customized to cover even more use cases. Conclusions FHIR-PYrate opens up the possibility to quickly and easily retrieve FHIR data, download image data, and search medical documents for keywords within a Python package. With the demonstrated functionality, FHIR-PYrate opens an easy way to assemble research collectives automatically.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

this paper proposes a novel model for hyperspectral image classification using an orthogonal self attention ResNet and a two step support vector machine OSANet TSSVM The OSANet TSSVM model comprises two essential components a deep feature extraction network and an improved support vector machine SVM classification module The deep feature extraction network incorporates an orthogonal self attention module OSM and a channel attention module CAM to enhance the spatial spectral feature extraction The OSM focuses on computing D self attention weights for the orthogonal dimensions of an image resulting in a reduced number of parameters while capturing comprehensive global contextual information In contrast the CAM independently learns attention weights along the channel dimension The CAM autonomously learns attention weights along the channel dimension enabling the deep network to emphasise crucial channel information and enhance the spectral feature extraction capability In addition to the feature extraction network the OSANet TSSVM model leverages an improved SVM classification module known as the two step support vector machine TSSVM model This module preserves the discriminative outcomes of the first level SVM subclassifier and remaps them as new features for the TSSVM training By integrating the results of the two classifiers the deficiencies of the individual classifiers were effectively compensated resulting in significantly enhanced classification accuracy The performance of the proposed OSANet TSSVM model was thoroughly evaluated using public datasets The experimental results demonstrated that the model performed well in both subjective and objective evaluation metrics The superiority of this model highlights its potential for advancing hyperspectral image classification in remote sensing applications\",\n          \"AI powered records science is revolutionizing the way facts are analyzed and understood It can significantly improve

Classification is a fundamental task in information extraction and retrieval with a goal to assign given resource to a predefined class. In some cases, as in slides\\u2019 categorization, resources can belong to multiple classes, leading to a multi-labelled classification problem. Two different approaches for solving a multi-labelled image classification problem for the purpose of a presentation recommender system are suggested and evaluated in the paper. They are based on problem transformation and algorithm adaptation strategies and utilize a convolutional neural network for model training.\",\n          \"Background We present FHIR-PYrate, a Python package to handle the full clinical data collection and extraction process. The software is to be plugged into a modern hospital domain, where electronic patient records are used to handle the entire patient\\u2019s history. Most research institutes follow the same procedures to build study cohorts, but mainly in a non-standardized and repetitive way. As a result, researchers spend time writing boilerplate code, which could be used for more challenging tasks. Methods The package can improve and simplify existing processes in the clinical research environment. It collects all needed functionalities into a straightforward interface that can be used to query a FHIR server, download imaging studies and filter clinical documents. The full capacity of the search mechanism of the FHIR REST API is available to the user, leading to a uniform querying process for all resources, thus simplifying the customization of each use case. Additionally, valuable features like parallelization and filtering are included to make it more performant. Results As an exemplary practical application, the package can be used to analyze the prognostic significance of routine CT imaging and clinical data in breast cancer with tumor metastases in the lungs. In this example, the initial patient cohort is first collected using ICD-10 codes. For these patients, the survival information is also gathered. Some additional clinical data is retrieved, and CT scans of the thorax are downloaded. Finally, the survival analysis can be computed using a deep learning model with the CT scans, the TNM staging and positivity of relevant markers as input. This process may vary depending on the FHIR server and available clinical data, and can be customized to cover even more use cases. Conclusions FHIR-PYrate opens up the possibility to quickly and easily retrieve FHIR data, download image data, and search medical documents for keywords within a Python package. With the demonstrated functionality, FHIR-PYrate opens an easy way to assemble research collectives automatically.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

in remote sensing image analysis by classifying pixels However the existing methods require more spatial global information interaction and feature extraction capabilities To overcome these challenges this paper proposes a novel model for hyperspectral image classification using an orthogonal self attention ResNet and a two step support vector machine OSANet TSSVM The OSANet TSSVM model comprises two essential components a deep feature extraction network and an improved support vector machine SVM classification module The deep feature extraction network incorporates an orthogonal self attention module OSM and a channel attention module CAM to enhance the spatial spectral feature extraction The OSM focuses on computing D self attention weights for the orthogonal dimensions of an image resulting in a reduced number of parameters while capturing comprehensive global contextual information In contrast the CAM independently learns attention weights along the channel dimension The

uses the entire arsenal of knowledge of natural and exact sciences to create its theoretical framework terms tasks and research methods The paper describes the achievements current trends and actual directions of development of ecotoxicology considering their theoretical and practical significance Nowadays ecotoxicology has formed a set of data on effects and behaviors of ecotoxicants in populations and communities of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems This set of data is at the heart of the theoretical foundation of the doctrine on functioning of biosystems under ecotoxicological stress assessment of systems conditions by bioindication and bioassay techniques approaches to develop of ecotoxicants regulation within the framework of the concept of acceptable environmental impact on ecosystems Special attention is paid to multi vector nature of ecotoxicological research its cooperation with other areas of science and technology and contribution to the solution of environmental economic and political challenges of our time\",\n          \"Hyperspectral image classification plays a crucial role in remote sensing image analysis by classifying pixels However the existing methods require more spatial global information interaction and feature extraction capabilities To overcome these challenges this paper proposes a novel model for hyperspectral image classification using an orthogonal self attention ResNet and a two step support vector machine OSANet TSSVM The OSANet TSSVM model comprises two essential components a deep feature extraction network and an improved support vector machine SVM classification module The deep feature extraction network incorporates an orthogonal self attention module OSM and a channel attention module CAM to enhance the spatial spectral feature extraction The OSM focuses on computing D self attention weights for the orthogonal dimensions of an image resulting in a reduced number of parameters while capturing comprehensive global contextual information In contrast the CAM independently learns attention weights along the channel dimension The CAM autonomously learns attention weights along the channel dimension enabling the deep network to emphasise crucial channel information and enhance the spectral feature extraction capability In addition to the feature extraction network the OSANet TSSVM model leverages an

The paper describes the achievements, current trends and actual directions of development of ecotoxicology considering their theoretical and practical significance. Nowadays ecotoxicology has formed a set of data on effects and behaviors of ecotoxicants in populations and communities of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This set of data is at the heart of the theoretical foundation of the doctrine on functioning of biosystems under ecotoxicological stress, assessment of systems conditions by bioindication and bioassay techniques, approaches to develop of ecotoxicants regulation within the framework of the concept of acceptable environmental impact on ecosystems. Special attention is paid to multi-vector nature of ecotoxicological research, its cooperation with other areas of science and technology and contribution to the solution of environmental, economic and political challenges of our time.\",\n          \"Recommender systems are super popular nowadays for giving personalized recommendations to users.

Classification is a fundamental task in information extraction and retrieval with a goal to assign given resource to a predefined class. In some cases, as in slides\\u2019 categorization, resources can belong to multiple classes, leading to a multi-labelled classification problem. Two different approaches for solving a multi-labelled image classification problem for the purpose of a presentation recommender system are suggested and evaluated in the paper. They are based on problem transformation and algorithm adaptation strategies and utilize a convolutional neural network for model training.\",\n          \"Background We present FHIR-PYrate, a Python package to handle the full clinical data collection and extraction process.

As a result, researchers spend time writing boilerplate code, which could be used for more challenging tasks. Methods The package can improve and simplify existing processes in the clinical research environment. It collects all needed functionalities into a straightforward interface that can be used to query a FHIR server, download imaging studies and filter clinical documents. The full capacity of the search mechanism of the FHIR REST API is available to the user, leading to a uniform querying process for all resources, thus simplifying the customization of each use case. Additionally, valuable features like parallelization and filtering are included to make it more performant. Results As an exemplary practical application, the package can be used to analyze the prognostic significance of routine CT imaging and clinical data in breast cancer with tumor metastases in the lungs. In this example, the initial patient cohort is first collected using ICD-10 codes. For these patients, the survival information is also gathered. Some additional clinical data is retrieved, and CT scans of the thorax are downloaded. Finally, the survival analysis can be computed using a deep learning model with the CT scans, the TNM staging and positivity of relevant markers as input. This process may vary depending on the FHIR server and available clinical data, and can be customized to cover even more use cases. Conclusions FHIR-PYrate opens up the possibility to quickly and easily retrieve FHIR data, download image data, and search medical documents for keywords within a Python package. With the demonstrated functionality, FHIR-PYrate opens an easy way to assemble research collectives automatically.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

Nowadays ecotoxicology has formed a set of data on effects and behaviors of ecotoxicants in populations and communities of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This set of data is at the heart of the theoretical foundation of the doctrine on functioning of biosystems under ecotoxicological stress, assessment of systems conditions by bioindication and bioassay techniques, approaches to develop of ecotoxicants regulation within the framework of the concept of acceptable environmental impact on ecosystems. Special attention is paid to multi-vector nature of ecotoxicological research, its cooperation with other areas of science and technology and contribution to the solution of environmental, economic and political challenges of our time.\",\n          \"Recommender systems are super popular nowadays for giving personalized recommendations to users. The paper focuses on a special type of recommender system aimed to advise an improvement of a user\\u2019s presentation based on slides classification. Classification is a fundamental task in information extraction and retrieval with a goal to assign given resource to a predefined class. In some cases, as in slides\\u2019 categorization, resources can belong to multiple classes, leading to a multi-labelled classification problem. Two different approaches for solving a multi-labelled image classification problem for the purpose of a presentation recommender system are suggested and evaluated in the paper. They are based on problem transformation and algorithm adaptation strategies and utilize a convolutional neural network for model training.\",\n          \"Background We present FHIR-PYrate, a Python package to handle the full clinical data collection and extraction process. The software is to be plugged into a modern hospital domain, where electronic patient records are used to handle the entire patient\\u2019s history. Most research institutes follow the same procedures to build study cohorts, but mainly in a non-standardized and repetitive way. As a result, researchers spend time writing boilerplate code, which could be used for more challenging tasks. Methods The package can improve and simplify existing processes in the clinical research environment. It collects all needed functionalities into a straightforward interface that can be used to query a FHIR server, download imaging studies and filter clinical documents. The full capacity of the search mechanism of the FHIR REST API is available to the user, leading to a uniform querying process for all resources, thus simplifying the customization of each use case. Additionally, valuable features like parallelization and filtering are included to make it more performant. Results As an exemplary practical application, the package can be used to analyze the prognostic significance of routine CT imaging and clinical data in breast cancer with tumor metastases in the lungs. In this example, the initial patient cohort is first collected using ICD-10 codes. For these patients, the survival information is also gathered. Some additional clinical data is retrieved, and CT scans of the thorax are downloaded. Finally, the survival analysis can be computed using a deep learning model with the CT scans, the TNM staging and positivity of relevant markers as input. This process may vary depending on the FHIR server and available clinical data, and can be customized to cover even more use cases. Conclusions FHIR-PYrate opens up the possibility to quickly and easily retrieve FHIR data, download image data, and search medical documents for keywords within a Python package. With the demonstrated functionality, FHIR-PYrate opens an easy way to assemble research collectives automatically.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

By analyzing multi-dimensional, multiomic, spatial pathology, and radiomic data, these technologies enable a deeper understanding of the intricate molecular pathways, aiding in the identification of critical nodes within the tumor\\u2019s biology to optimize treatment selection. The applications of AI/ML in precision oncology are extensive and include the generation of synthetic data, e.g., digital twins, in order to provide the necessary information to design or expedite the conduct of clinical trials. Currently, many operational and technical challenges exist related to data technology, engineering, and storage; algorithm development and structures; quality and quantity of the data and the analytical pipeline; data sharing and generalizability; and the incorporation of these technologies into the current clinical workflow and reimbursement models.\",\n          \"\\u2013 Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the RAVDESS dataset to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and calm from speech. Key features like MFCC, Chroma, and Mel spectrogram are extracted to represent the emotional content of audio signals. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is trained to classify these features into predefined emotion categories. The system is developed using Python and integrated with a Flask-based web interface. It achieves an impressive accuracy of 82% in emotion detection. This model has applications in virtual assistants, healthcare, and enhancing human-computer interaction through empathetic responses. Feature extraction is efficiently handled using the Librosa library, streamlining the processing pipeline. Noise reduction techniques are also applied to improve recognition accuracy in real-world environments. The system's UI allows users to input speech and get real-time emotion feedback. Overall, this project contributes to the advancement of empathetic AI technologies.\",\n          \"Background Hypertension (HTN) is a global public health concern and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Insulin resistance (IR) plays a crucial role in HTN-related metabolic dysfunction, but its assessment remains challenging. The triglyceride\\u2013glucose (TyG) index and its derivatives (TyG\\u2013BMI, TyG\\u2013WC, and TyG\\u2013WHtR) have emerged as reliable IR markers. In this study, we evaluated their associations with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hypertensive patients using machine learning techniques. Methods Data from 9432 hypertensive participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999\\u20132018 were analysed. Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were employed to explore mortality risk and potential nonlinear relationships. Machine learning models were utilized to assess the predictive value of the TyG index and its derivatives for mortality outcomes. Results The TyG index and its derivatives were independent predictors of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hypertensive patients. The TyG\\u2013WHtR exhibited the strongest association, with each 1-unit increase linked to a 41.7% and 48.1% higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. L-shaped relationships were observed between TyG-related indices and mortality. The incorporation of the TyG index or its derivatives into predictive models modestly improved the prediction performance for mortality outcomes. Conclusions The TyG index and its derivatives are significant predictors of mortality in hypertensive patients. Their inclusion in predictive models enhances risk stratification and may aid in the early identification of high-risk individuals in this population. Further studies are needed to validate these findings in external hypertensive cohorts.
